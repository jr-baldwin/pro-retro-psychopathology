The script to derive adjusted effect sizes (i.e., partial correlations) for the associations between prospective and retrospective measures with psychopathology is shown in the file "[adjusted_effects_20231219.R](https://github.com/jr-baldwin/pro-retro-psychopathology/blob/main/adjusted_effects_20231219.R)".
